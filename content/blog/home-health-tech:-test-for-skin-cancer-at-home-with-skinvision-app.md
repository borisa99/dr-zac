### The stats on skin cancer in Australia are grim.

Approximately two in three Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer by the time they are 70.

More than 750,000 people are treated for one or more non-melanoma skin cancers in Australia each year.

GPs have over 1 million patient consultations per year for skin cancer. That’s the entire population of Adelaide!

The good new is, there is now an app on the market called SkinVision to help you monitor the progression of any dodgy moles or spots, so you can better inform your doctor.

It’s super simple to use, you can even train your grandparents to get with the digital age!

Take a photo of the mole or spot you wish to check. Wait for the app to analyse the image, then save the picture so you can keep an eye on it.

SkinVision boasts an 88 percent sensitivity rate for melanoma but should be used in conjunction with yearly skin checks with a GP or dermatologist.

SkinVision is free and available for both iPhone and Android on the App Store and Google Play ([skinvision.com](https://www.skinvision.com/)).
