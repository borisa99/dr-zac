### Some of the best ways to help maintain healthy skin around your entire body turn out to be some of the cheapest!

Some of the most common skin care-related problems are induced by stress and dehydration, so make sure you get your 3 litres a day in addition to taking the odd chill pill. In addition to increasing water intake and reducing stress levels, here are my top 3 tips to get scrubbin’ and #lovetheskinyourein.

**Tip # 1 – Take salt baths or scrub with salts in the shower.** This helps your body retain moisture, promotes cellular regeneration, detoxifies skin, and helps heal dry, scaling irritated skin such as eczema.

**Tip # 2 – Improve your air quality.** Adding a humidifier in the bedroom will help your skin throughout the night and can have you waking up with less breakouts.

**Tip # 3 – Use a lotion at night with higher concentrations of Vitamin E.** This will help protect and nourish the skin better than a moisturizer without Vitamin E, which is trending right now in the skin care industry as a powerful anti-oxidant and free radical fighter.
