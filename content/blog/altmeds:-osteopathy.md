### Curious about alternative therapies? You’re not alone! It’s a vast world of drug-free health practice and can be confusing at the best of times.

As with any professional, it’s important to see the right person for the right job. You wouldn’t go to a hairdresser for a toothache (!) so it makes sense to familiarise yourself with the vast range of practitioners out there.

As a GP, I am frequently asked about what an Osteopath does. Read on to learn more about Osteopathy could potentially help you.

#### What Is Osteopathy?

Osteopathy is a form of drug-free non-invasive manual medicine that focuses on total body health.

Osteopaths believe that massage, movement, stretching and physical manipulation are important for postural alignment.

Beginning in the late 1800s, Osteopathy is a form of manual therapy, recognising the link between the structure of the body and the way it functions.

#### Qualifications & Education

According to Osteopathy Australia, all osteopaths in Australia complete a minimum of five years university training in anatomy, physiology, pathology, general medical diagnosis and osteopathic techniques.

They are also trained to perform standard medical examinations of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems.

These university graduates hold either a double Bachelors or Master qualification.

Osteopaths are required, by law, to maintain ongoing professional development and education every year to stay in practice.

#### Who Should See An Osteopath?

The main reason to visit an Osteopath is if you are experiencing bone, muscle and/or joint problems associated with the following symptoms:

- Back Pain
- Neck Pain
- Headaches and Migraines
- Musculoskeletal Conditions during Pregnancy
- Treating children
- Pain Management

An Osteopath may look at the area that is troubling you, as well as other parts of your body. For example if you have a sore knee, your osteopath may also look at your ankle, pelvis and back. In addition to the consultation, the Osteopath may provide education and advice to help you manage your condition between treatments. This may include giving you exercises to do at home or work.
