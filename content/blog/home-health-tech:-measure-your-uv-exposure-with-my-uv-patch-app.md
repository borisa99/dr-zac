### Before we check for skin cancer, there’s actually a new app to help stop us developing it in the first place!

La Roche-Posay My UV Patch (free with the purchase of La Roche-Posay sunscreen at most pharmacies, [laroche-posay.com.au](http://www.laroche-posay.com.au/)) is a thin, flexible patch which measures sun exposure when connected to the My UV Patch app (free from the App Store and Google Play).

This transparent adhesive is about the size of a fifty cent count and contains photosensitive dyes, which change colour when exposed to UV.

Use the app to scan the patch on your skin. The app will then determine your level of UV exposure.

You can sleep, exercise, shower and swim with the patch on for up to five days – you’ll forget it’s even there!

Although My UV Patch is certainly handy, it doesn’t automatically alert you if your UV levels are in the red zone. It’s up to you to keep checking your UV levels.
