### Have you ever experienced a disappointing massage? Sounds oxymoronic, but it’s entirely possible to feel robbed on the massage table – that is, if you sought the wrong technique for the wrong symptoms.

It’s easy to assume that all massages are the same. Don’t be fooled: there are key differences in technique that affects different parts of the body.

It’s worth noting that if you are unsatisfied with the result, it could be because of the practitioner; not necessarily the technique. Shop around to try the work of different professionals before giving up on the technique altogether.

#### Swedish and Thai massage are the most common massage therapies and are often confused for being the same thing.

In actuality, they couldn’t be further apart!

Thai massage stimulates acupressure points along the body’s Meridien lines in order to provide relief, stretch and loosen tightened muscles, release tension and relieve joints.

Thai massage is jokingly described as ‘lazy yoga’, as it stretches the body using as many postural changes as possible.

Thai is effective at mobilising joints and stretching out different muscle groups so you feel relaxed afterwards. It’s a wonderful modality to relax and provide stress relief.
