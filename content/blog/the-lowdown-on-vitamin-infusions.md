### YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT VITAMIN INFUSIONS ON THE GRAPEVINE AND THOUGHT, ‘WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?’, ‘DOES IT REPLACE FOOD’ or ‘DO I STILL NEED TO TAKE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS AFTER HAVING ONE’?

### READ ON TO LEARN MORE ABOUT VITAMIN INFUSIONS AND WHETHER IT COULD BE SOMETHING TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR.

#### WHAT IS A VITAMIN INFUSION?

Vitamin infusions for the most part are a great addition to an already healthy life-style where you’re already getting good nutrients.

For some people – especially those with poor nutrition or in other disease states – vitamin infusions can have hugely beneficial qualities.

As we know when we take things orally, many nutrients are not absorbed completely. Vitamin infusions are essentially giving your body a high dose of good vitamins that don’t depend on you bodies ability to absorb.

Many of the vitamins used are found in many foods we consume – or should be consuming regularly. It’s important to note that you should always consult your doctor about any kind of therapies to make sure it is right for you and to ensure that your practitioners are appropriately experienced and qualified.

#### I ALREADY TAKE VITAMINS – SO WHY DO I NEED THIS TREATMENT?

Vitamin infusions allow us to have higher doses of many vitamins in our circulation for a short time period, than we would otherwise be able to absorb.

This is extremely important in disease states where there is a large amount of clinical data supporting the use of high dose vitamin IV infusions for a variety of disease states, including cancer, burns, septic shock, thiamine deficiency, Rickets and Vitamin D deficiency to name a few.

For those of us who are well this is a great way to try to either prevent or end that cold that just won’t go away or I have it regularly before I travel to prevent getting sick.

#### WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM VITAMIN INFUSIONS AND WHAT RESULTS CAN BE EXPECTED?

Anyone feeling run-down or tired will benefit from an IV vitamin infusion. If you always get sick when starting a holiday, vitamin infusions can help a lot. People with chronic fatigue and many other diseases can also benefit from a vitamin infusion, in consultation with their doctor.

Whilst there have been no large population studies around the use of IV vitamins for skin benefits, there is large amounts of anecdotal advice that suggests vitamin infusions can help with brightening complexions and strengthening skin, nails and hair.

#### POST-TREATMENT, WHAT’S THE BEST WAY TO KEEP THE BENEFITS GOING?

It is best to drink a couple of litres of water both before and after the treatment – and of course to continue your normal healthy diet.
