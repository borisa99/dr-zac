Is your winter body giving you the sads?

So many of us fall off the exercise wagon as soon as the temperature drops; however, the best time to work on your summer body is actually in winter.

Having a clearly defined summer body goal is essential in knowing which exercises to do in winter. When it comes to your fitness, are you looking to lose weight, build muscle or tone your current body shape?

#### Tip #1 – Make Exercise A Part Of Your Every Day

Recent studies show ten minutes of daily exercise can give great results. Take a change of clothes to work and do stair climbs, hill sprints or even a fast-paced walk on your lunch break. If your schedule doesn’t allow you to go to the gym as often as you’d like, use the city as your gym.

#### Tip #2 – Get The Right Gear

If the cold weather is keeping you indoors, get into gear with the right training attire. Most mega department stores sell affordable basics, so look out for warm and lightweight layers. If you’re going to be running, make sure you invest in a good pair of trainers. You’re just a Northface puffer vest away from success.

#### Tip # 3 – Change Your Body’s Rhythm

The most efficient time to burn calories is first thing in the morning.

Some athletes fast before training, but you can cheat this by hitting the gym on an empty stomach first thing in the morning as a great way to target fat reserves. Try having a black coffee for some extra motivation, but make sure you stay hydrated.
