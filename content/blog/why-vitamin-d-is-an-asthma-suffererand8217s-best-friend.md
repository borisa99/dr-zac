### Asthma sufferers have another reason to breathe a sigh of relief.

A new study has revealed that Vitamin D – the common supplement found in most chemists and supermarkets – could help slash the risk of asthma attacks.

Scientists at the British Lacet Respiratory Medicine foundation discovered that taking Vitamin D halved the risk of severe asthma attacks requiring medical attention.

The trusty Vitamin D capsule is thought to have a 2-pronged approach for asthma sufferers by minimising harmful inflammation in the airways and boosting the immune system’s response to respiratory viruses.

However, it is important to note the study was conducted on a test group of adults suffering from mild to moderate asthma; children did not partake in the study.

Asthma is a long-term lung condition and claims over 400 lives per year in Australia, so the latest findings are certainly encouraging for chronic asthma sufferers.

If you are an asthma sufferer, it is important to take your usual medication – as prescribed by your doctor or GP – rather than replace with vitamin D capsules entirely.

Some added benefits of taking Vitamin D include regulating the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and facilitating normal immune system function.

What’s not to love about D?
