### As your day comes to an end, a good nighttime skincare routine is key in keeping a healthy-looking appearance.

Getting your skin ready for bedtime is almost like getting it prepped in the morning – except you’ll need to add a few additional steps…

**Tip # 1 – Cleanse your face – again.** Take off the make up, dirt and other pollutants that have attached themselves to your skin throughout the day. Find an exfoliating scrub that has a high percentage of glycolic acid – and if you can – find one with polylactic biodegradable beads, as these will work away the upper most layers of the skin, thus exposing a new layer underneath that will have all night to mature for tomorrow.

**Tip # 2 – After exfoliating, apply a heavy-duty serum that is dependent on your skin type.** You can use the same serum you use during your morning routine, but a serum containing collagen-reproducing peptides are best suited for nighttime care across skin types. After the serum has absorbed, follow with a nighttime moisturizing cream that is heavier and denser in consistency compared with your morning sunscreen.

**Tip # 3 – Most importantly, when it comes to applying skincare products to the face, using proper amounts are vital in overall care.** The skin on your the face is the most sensitive of all the body, with regards to applying products. Using too much can cause the skin to become irritated and break out. Using too little will show no results. Everyone has different skin types, so finding that proper balance between products and letting your skin do its own thing is key. It takes time, but be patient once you have found that perfect routine that your face agrees with – it’s smooth sailing from there!
