### Our skin is the body’s first form of contact with everything we come across throughout our day.

The occasional rash and blemish is unfortunately, somewhat inevitable. We’re only human after all!

Here are some signs to look out for and what not to worry about, about along with home remedies to help the itch!

**Olive Oil** – Rich in vitamin E and other antioxidants, olive oil helps healing those dry itchy rashes.

**Baking Soda** – For itchy, puss-oozing rashes, baking soda has a drying property, which will pull out liquid within the rashes to reduce recovery time. However, baking soda can further irritate the skin, so only do this for 3-5 minutes at a time – no more than three times a day.

**Allergy Tablets** – Most commonly used to treat those random hive break outs.

**Aloe Vera** – Best for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-fungal properties on any minor skin irritation or a dry, scaly patch.

**Cold Compression** – The best way to treat inflammation, best used for those insect bites and poison ivy rashes.

**Hydrocortisone Cream** – The mother treatment of all types of rashes and blemishes. Most rashes are temporary; however any rash that does not improve or completely go away after at least 3-4 days, you should go see your GP and seek further advice.
