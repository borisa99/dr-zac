### The Ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew it.

### ‘Aapri’-loving 70s babes knew it.

### And the millions of coffee-scrubbing beauty bloggers know it.

### Exfoliation is key to getting flawless skin.

### Read on to get the low down on saying buh-bye to dull, dry skin.

#### TIP #1: LESS IS MORE

Less is more when it comes to how often you scrub. Limit your use of exfoliators to once a week or less. Any more and the skin is not given a chance to regenerate.

#### TIP #2: GET A CHEMICAL PEEL

Chemical peels aid your skin’s cell renewal process. The process is not a ‘peel’ in the most literal sense of the word; rather, the ingredients dissolve the intracellular cement between dead skin cells. Although the effect is not immediately visible, in the long term, you’ll certainly have brighter, healthier skin.

#### TIP #3: AHAs: YOUR SKIN’S NEW BFF

Try a gentle cream that contains urea or alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), a proven natural exfoliant derived from fruits such as oranges and lemons. Check the label to make sure the AHA concentration label is 10% or less.

#### TIP #4: BEAT THE HEAT

In dryer months, your skin is more irritation-prone. Decrease your once a week exfoliation session to once every 2 weeks.

#### TIP #5: PROTECT WHAT YOU GOT

I can’t stress the importance of wearing sunscreen! If you have exfoliated too often in the past, the protective layer of the skin is more prone to sun damage. Make sure you put back in what you take away and protect the skin your in.
